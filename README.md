Listenr, take 2

I'm developing this in public so that it may serve as a resource for fellow developers making audio playing applications backed by online resources.

Tell me if you run into issues.

Once I get this in a comparable state to Listenr 1 featurewise, I'll go back and document it nicely. 
And maybe write up a few tutorials.

Enjoy.
